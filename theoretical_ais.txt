from easiest to hardest

random
one neural network
multi stage neural network
MCTS + stopping early + one neural network
MCTS + stopping early + MSNN (multi stage neural network)
MCTS
minimax + stopping early + one neural network <- same tournaments (below)
minimax + stopping early + multi stage neural network <- use tournaments to determine which network
minimax (+alpha beta because fucking have to why not)


tournament between NN -> generate like 10 neural networks, play against each other, pick the top % winner (if beat all of em) to iterate on, repeat
stopping early = at move X (eg 30), instead of playing the rest of the game, use the NN to eval
MSNN (multi stage neural network) use other neural networks (the later ones) as their value (instead of 0, 1, use the % from the late game neural network as the val)
